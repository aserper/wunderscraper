# Wunderground Local Scraper - Home Assistant Integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This is a simple but effective Home Assistant integration that scrapes weather data from a specific Wunderground Personal Weather Station (PWS) page.

It provides local weather data directly from a source you choose, without needing an API key. Just point it at a station URL, and it will create sensor entities for all the key metrics.

## Installation

1.  **Copy the Integration Files:**
    Copy the `wunderground_scraper` directory from this repository into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

2.  **Restart Home Assistant:**
    Restart your Home Assistant instance to allow it to detect the new integration.

## Configuration

1.  Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2.  Click **Add Integration** and search for **Wunderground Scraper**.
3.  Enter the full URL of the Wunderground PWS you want to monitor (e.g., `https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/ma/newyork/KNYNEWYO1959`).
4.  Click **Submit**.

The integration will automatically create all available sensors.

*   Temperature
